## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate foundational AWS cloud skills in a practical, hands-on way.

The focus of this project is to show that I understand:
- How cloud infrastructure is structured
- How applications run on cloud infrastructure
- How to think about cost, security, and simplicity from the start

This project is being built slowly and intentionally to ensure deep understanding rather than surface-level familiarity.
