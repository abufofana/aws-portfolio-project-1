#AWS Portfolio Project 1

## Overview 
This repository documents my first hands-on AWS project, built from scrath as part of my transition from IT Helpdesk into Cloud Engineering.


The goal of this project is not just to make something work, but to fully understand:
- What I am building
- Why each AWS Service is used
- How the pieves fit together in a real-world environment


This project is intentionally begineer-friendly and focuses on strong fundamentals.
